## Top Features You Can Use Today

### 1. Add Text and Shapes
Need to fill out a non-interactive form? The [Edit PDF](/edit) tool allows you to type text anywhere on the page. You can also add rectangles, circles, and checkmarks to highlight important information.

Printing, signing, and scanning is a relic of the past. Use the [Sign PDF](/sign) tool to draw your signature once and apply it to unlimited contracts. It's legally binding and looks professional.

### 3. Organize Pages
Did you scan a document upside down? Use the [Organize Tool](/organize) or [Rotate Tool](/rotate) to fix orientation, delete blank pages, or rearrange the flow of your document.

### 4. Compress for Email
Large PDF files often get bounced by email servers. The [Compress PDF](/compress) tool reduces file size by up to 90% without noticeable quality loss.

### 5. Convert to Word
Sometimes you need to make heavy edits. Converting your [PDF to Word](/convert) gives you a fully editable document in seconds.

# Is Online PDF Conversion Safe?

When uploading sensitive contracts, financial statements, or personal ID documents to a website, "Is this safe?" should be your first question.

## The Risks of Traditional Converters
Many older online tools upload your file to a remote server, process it, and sit on it for hours (or days) before deletion. This creates a risk window where data could theoretically be accessed.

## The Docorio Difference: Client-Side Processing

**Docorio** represents a new generation of privacy-first tools.

### 1. Browser-Based Technology
We use advanced technologies like **WebAssembly** and **PDF.js** to run complex operations *directly on your device*. 
*   When you **Merge** files, your CPU does the work.
*   When you **Compress** a PDF, it happens in your browser's memory.

### 2. No Permanent Storage
For tools that strictly require server assistance (like converting PDF to Office formats), files are transmitted via **256-bit SSL Encryption** (the same standard used by banks). Most importantly, they are **automatically deleted** immediately after the transaction is complete.

### 3. No Account Required
We don't ask for your email, phone number, or credit card. We don't track your "usage history" to build a profile on you. You simply come, work, and leave.

## Best Practices for Document Security
*   **Redact Sensitive Info**: Before sharing a document, use our [Redact Tool](/redact) to permanently black out social security numbers or addresses.
*   **Password Protect**: Use the [Protect Tool](/protect) to add strong AES encryption to your files.

Your privacy is our business. Trust **Docorio** for secure, private document management.

# How to Reduce PDF File Size for Email

We've all been there: you try to send an important document, and Gmail yells at you for exceeding the 25MB attachment limit. The solution isn't to split your file into ten parts—it's to **compress** it.

## Why are PDFs so big?
PDFs often contain high-resolution images, embedded fonts, and hidden metadata that bloat the file size.

## The Solution: Smart Compression
Using the [Compress PDF](/compress) tool, you can remove this excess data while keeping the visible document looking sharp.

### How to Compress:
1.  Go to the **Compress PDF** tool.
2.  Upload your heavy file.
3.  The tool automatically optimizes images and fonts.
4.  Download a file that is often **50-80% smaller**.

Now you can attach it to any email client without issues.

# Electronic vs Digital Signatures

While often used interchangeably, these two terms mean very different things in the world of online documents.

## Electronic Signature (eSign)
An electronic signature is a broad term for any electronic process that indicates acceptance of an agreement. This includes:
*   Typing your name at the bottom of an email.
*   Checking a "I Agree" box.
*   Drawing your signature on a screen using our [Sign PDF](/sign) tool.

**Key Takeaway**: Fast, easy, and legally binding for most business contracts.

## Digital Signature
A digital signature is a specific *type* of electronic signature that uses encryption technology to verify the identity of the signer and ensure the document hasn't been tampered with. It acts like a digital "fingerprint."

## Which do you need?
For 99% of general business agreements, tax forms, and rental contracts, a standard **Electronic Signature** (like the one Docorio provides) is perfectly widely accepted and legally robust.

# Convert PDF to Images

Sharing a PDF on social media is impossible. Instagram and Twitter only accept image formats like JPG or PNG.

## The Workaround: PDF to JPG
Instead of taking a blurry screenshot of your document, use a dedicated converter.

### Steps:
1.  Upload your file to the [PDF to Image](/pdf-to-jpg) tool.
2.  Select "Convert all pages" or specify a range.
3.  Choose your quality (High is recommended for print).
4.  Download a ZIP file containing each page as a separate, crisp image.

## Why use this over screenshots?
*   **Resolution**: Screenshots are limited to your screen size. Our converter renders at 300 DPI (print quality).
*   **Transparency**: We can save pages as transparent PNGs if needed.

# Extract Text from Scanned Documents

We've all received a "document" that is actually just a photo taken with a phone. You can't copy-paste text from it... or can you?

## Enter OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
OCR technology scans an image, recognizes shapes that look like letters, and converts them into digital text.

### How to use Docorio's OCR:
1.  Go to the [Scanner/OCR Tool](/scanner).
2.  Upload your JPG, PNG, or PDF file.
3.  The text will be extracted and displayed in a side-by-side view.
4.  Copy the text or download it as a .txt file.

This is a lifesaver for students digitizing notes or professionals recovering data from old receipts.

# Adding Passwords to Your PDFs

Sharing financial data, medical records, or legal drafts via email comes with risks. If your email account is compromised, those attachments are vulnerable.

## The Solution: File-Level Encryption
By adding a password directly to the PDF, you ensure that even if a hacker steals the file, they cannot open it without the key.

### Guide:
1.  Open the [Protect PDF](/protect) tool.
2.  Upload your document.
3.  Enter a strong password (mix of letters and numbers).
4.  Download your locked file.

**Note**: There is no "forgot password" feature for encrypted PDFs. If you lose the password, the data is gone forever. This is a feature, not a bug!

3.  Click the pages you want to keep (or extract).

You can also use the **Auto Split** feature to break a document into equal chunks (e.g., "Split every 5 pages").

Without access to the giant office photocopier, remote workers need reliable digital alternatives.

## 1. Scanner (Mobile Friendly)
Don't buy a scanner. Use your phone's camera and our [Scanner Tool](/scanner) to turn photos into professional, cropped, black-and-white documents.

## 2. eSign
Stop printing contracts just to sign them. Use [Sign PDF](/sign) to add your signature digitally.

## 3. Merge
Combine your signed contract, ID proof, and cover letter into one comprehensive PDF packet using [Merge PDF](/merge).

## 4. Compress
Home internet upload speeds can be slow. Always [Compress](/compress) large files before hopping on a Zoom call or sending an email.

## 5. Converter
Clients send files in weird formats. Use the [Universal Converter](/convert) to switch between Word, PDF, JPG, and Excel effortlessly.

# The Legality of eSignings

One question we get asked constantly: "Will this hold up in court?"

## The Short Answer: Yes.
In the United States, the **ESIGN Act (2000)** and **UETA** grant electronic signatures the same legal status as handwritten ones. If a law ensures a signature, an electronic one suffices.

## Europe (eIDAS)
In the EU, the **eIDAS Regulation** provides a standardized framework for secure digital transactions across European borders.

## When to use Ink?
Very few documents still require a "wet" signature today. These typically include:
*   Wills and Trusts
*   Specific types of real estate foreclosures
*   Court orders

For almost everything else—sales contracts, NDAs, employment offers—an eSignature from **Docorio** is fast, secure, and legally recognized.

# The Battle of Formats: PDF vs Word

Choosing the right file format can determine whether your resume gets read or thrown in the digital trash.

## Microsoft Word (.docx)
**Best for: Editing**
Word is a *creation* tool. It's designed for drafting, editing, and collaborating. The file contents are fluid—text reflows based on printer settings, fonts installed, and screen size.

## Portable Document Format (.pdf)
**Best for: Sharing**
PDF is a *distribution* tool. It is designed to look **exactly the same** on every device. 

## The Golden Rule
*   If you are **working on** the document: Use Word.
*   If you are **sending** the document: [Convert it to PDF](/convert).

Sending a resume in Word is risky because the formatting might break on the recruiter's computer. Sending a PDF ensures your carefully designed layout remains perfect.

# Understanding OCR

**Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** is the magic that lets you search through a scanned PDF.

# Flattening PDFs Explained

When you fill out a digital form, the fields remain "interactive". Meaning, someone else could change your answers later.

## Why Flatten?
Flattening merges the interactive layer with the background layer.
*   **Security**: Prevents changing filled data.
*   **Compatibility**: Ensures the form looks filled on all viewers (even mobile).

# Fixing Broken PDFs

PDFs can get corrupted during download or email transfer.

## Symptoms
*   Blank pages.
*   Error messages like "Format error: not a PDF".
*   Missing images.

## Solutions
1.  **Redownload**: Often it's just a partial download.
2.  **Use Repair Tool**: Our [Repair PDF](/repair) tool attempts to rebuild the file header and structure to salvage readable content.
3.  **Text Recovery**: If the visual formatting is gone, try extracting the raw text using [PDF to Text](/pdf-to-text).

# User vs Owner Passwords

Not all PDF locks are the same.

## 1. User Password (Open Password)
This stops people from **opening** the file. If they don't have the code, they see nothing. This is high security.

## 2. Owner Password (Permissions Password)
This allows people to open and read the file, but stops them from **printing**, **copying text**, or **editing**. This is "restrictions" security.

You can set both types using our advanced [Protect Tool](/protect).

We've all seen it: a spreadsheet where the last column is printed on a separate page. It's unreadable.

1.  Before converting, set your **Print Area** in Excel.

# The Camelot Project

In 1991, John Warnock (Adobe co-founder) wrote a paper outlining a system to make documents viewable on any computer. He called it "Camelot". This became the PDF.

## Why it won
Before PDF, sharing documents was a nightmare. If you didn't have the same fonts installed as the sender, the document looked like garbage. PDF embedded the fonts *inside* the file. 

Today, billions of PDFs are created every day, and tools like Docorio keep the format accessible to everyone.

# Extracting vs Converting

If you use a "PDF to Image" converter, you get a picture of the *whole page*. But what if you just want the logo in the corner, or the photo of the building?

## Use the Extractor
Our [Extract Images](/extract-images) tool digs into the code of the PDF file and pulls out the original JPG or PNG assets that were embedded during creation.

## Benefits
*   **Highest Quality**: You get the exact file the designer used.
*   **No Text**: You get just the image, without the text that might be written over it.

# Resizing Page Standards

*   **USA/Canada**: Uses "Letter" (8.5 x 11 in).
*   **Rest of World**: Uses "A4" (210 x 297 mm).

If you send an A4 PDF to a US printer, it might get cut off.

## The Fix
Use the [Resize PDF](/resize) tool. It scales the content to fit the new page standard, adding white margins if necessary to prevent distortion.

# What is Metadata?

Every PDF contains hidden "tags" describing it:
*   **Author Name**
*   **Creation Date**
*   **Software Used** (e.g., "Microsoft Word 2013")

## Why remove it?
For legal or privacy reasons, you might not want the recipient to know the document was created by "John Doe" on a computer named "John's Macbook".

## How to scrub
The [Edit Metadata](/metadata) tool allows you to view these hidden fields and wipe them clean or change them to generic values before publishing.

# Making PDFs Inclusive

A standard image-based PDF is invisible to a blind person using a screen reader.

## Key Steps for Accessibility
1.  **OCR**: Ensure there is selectable text, not just images of text.
2.  **Alt Text**: Add descriptions to images.
3.  **Tags**: Define headers ($ H1, H2 $) so the reader can navigate structure.
4.  **Contrast**: Ensure text colors are high contrast against the background.

Inclusive design benefits everyone, not just those with disabilities.
